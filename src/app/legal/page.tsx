            <p>
              At paste.zhd.app ("we", "our", "us"), we are committed to
              protecting your privacy and maintaining transparency about how we
              collect, use, and protect your information.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>a. Content Data</h3>
            <p>
              When you submit a paste, we store the content, selected syntax,
              expiry time, and a generated slug to make it accessible by URL.
            </p>

            <h3>b. Technical Information</h3>
            <p>
              We collect IP addresses and user agent data to monitor abuse,
              detect malicious activity, and understand basic usage analytics.
              This data is stored securely and not shared with third parties.
            </p>

            <h3>c. Cookies and Local Storage</h3>
            <p>
              We may use localStorage to save user preferences (like auto-copy
              settings). No tracking cookies or third-party trackers are used.
            </p>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>

                To automatically expire and delete pastes after their set
                duration
              </li>
              <li>To detect abuse and maintain platform safety</li>
